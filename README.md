PC assemble and disassemble during TIS class

Reflection:

during TIS class in Semester 1 2023/2024 UTMJB, my and my group members joined the PC lab class where we had a mission to disassemble and assemble pc parts step by step. This class was so fun where it was my first time to meet my group members and then we worked together to achieve the goals of the lab. After we finnished assembling, we powered on the pc and it worked. after that we had a quiz on the same topic where we wrote the steps 1 by 1 on how to reassemble the pc.
